            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>BITS Pilani has launched an innovative PhD Program called as PhD-DRIVE (Deeptech Research, Innovation, Value generation & Entrepreneurship) that will result in creation of a startup based on research done during the PhD. This program focuses on creation of deep tech and deep science startup ventures, that will solve some of the most critical societal and business challenges. This is keeping in line with BITS Pilani’s history of introducing innovations in the higher education space over the past 60 Years, be it the Practice School concept, the first ever dual-degree programs or newer pedagogical practices.</p>
            <p>PhD-DRIVE program will begin with a research problem in a few contemporary but futuristic domains. The core of the program will also include course work on venture creation, and mentoring by entrepreneurs and investors. Typically, such a program would see PhD completion in 3-4 years of timeframe.</p>
